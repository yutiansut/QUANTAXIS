# Testcase Example:  '[2,7,11,15]\n9'
#
# Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they
# add up to a specific target.
# 
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may
# not use the same element twice.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
# 
# Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
# return [0, 1].
